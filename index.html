		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>I'm Nikolai Pesudovs, a high school student with a strong interest in coding and technology. I'm currently focusing on Python, web development, and Swift programming, and I'd like to share some of my work with you through this coding portfolio. 
			Python has become a language I find particularly versatile and useful for solving problems and creating applications.
			In the realm of web development, I've worked on building websites that are functional and somewhat visually appealing. I have experience with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript and enjoy projects that require a mix of creativity and technical know-how.
			Swift, which is used for iOS app development, is another area of interest for me. I'm interested in creating mobile a mobile application that provide value to users (See OcularLog).
			Coding is an ongoing journey of learning and growth, and I'm committed to collaborating with others and contributing to the open-source community. Through this portfolio, I aim to showcase my projects and the progress I've made while learning to code.
			Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring the intersections of technology, art, and science. When I'm not coding, you can find me experimenting with new tech gadgets, or keeping up with industry trends.
			Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I'm looking forward to connecting with others who share my interest in coding and technology.</p>
